# AIR-QUALITY-MONITORING-SYSTEM


OBJECTIVE:

The aim of this project is to design and develop a portable, low-cost air quality monitoring device using an Arduino microcontroller that can accurately measure and display the Air Quality Index (AQI), temperature, and humidity levels in real time. This device will enable individuals and communities to monitor environmental conditions in their surroundings, providing essential data that promotes awareness of air quality and its potential impact on health and comfort. By providing this accessible monitoring solution.
