# AIR-QUALITY-MONITORING-SYSTEM


OBJECTIVE:

The aim of this project is to design and develop a portable, low-cost air quality monitoring device using an Arduino microcontroller that can accurately measure and display the Air Quality Index (AQI), temperature, and humidity levels in real time. This device will enable individuals and communities to monitor environmental conditions in their surroundings, providing essential data that promotes awareness of air quality and its potential impact on health and comfort. By providing this accessible monitoring solution.

Key Features:
- Use sensors compatible with Arduino (such as MQ-series gas sensors, PMS5003 for PM, etc.).
- Display readings on an LCD.
This device can be used in homes, offices, or outdoor environments to monitor pollution levels and support informed decisions about air quality management.

ABSTRACT:

Air pollution is a critical environmental issue that directly impacts human health, particularly in urban areas where pollutant concentrations can rise to hazardous levels. This project presents the development of a low-cost, portable air quality monitoring device using an Arduino microcontroller. The device is designed to measure key air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), providing real-time monitoring and display of air quality data. Utilizing sensors such as the MQ-series and PMS5003, the device captures pollutant levels, displays the data on an LCD screen, and can optionally store data or transmit it for remote access. Additionally, the device features programmable alert thresholds, allowing users to be notified when pollutant levels exceed safe limits. This project aims to create an accessible solution for individuals and communities to understand better and respond to air quality issues, thereby promoting healthier environments and increasing awareness of air pollution's effects on health.

INTRODUCTION:

Air pollution poses serious health risks, particularly in densely populated and industrial areas, where pollutants like particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can reach dangerous levels. However, personal and community access to air quality data remains limited due to the high cost and inaccessibility of large-scale monitoring stations. This project addresses this need by developing a portable, affordable air quality monitoring device using an Arduino microcontroller. Equipped with various sensors, the device measures key pollutants in real time and displays this information on an LCD screen, enabling users to monitor air quality in homes, offices, and outdoor environments. Configurable alert thresholds provide immediate notifications when pollutant levels exceed safe limits, while optional data storage and wireless transmission support long-term tracking and analysis. This device offers an accessible solution to raise awareness and promote healthier environments by empowering individuals to monitor and respond to local air quality conditions.
